# Mutual Fund Performance Prediction System

A comprehensive machine learning system for predicting mutual fund performance, specifically identifying funds likely to underperform (bottom quintile performers). This system combines advanced feature engineering, multiple machine learning algorithms, and sophisticated backtesting capabilities to provide actionable investment insights.

## 🎯 Project Overview

### Problem Statement
Mutual fund selection is critical for portfolio performance, yet identifying poor performers before significant losses occur remains challenging. This system predicts which funds are likely to be in the bottom 20% of performers based on their 3-year Sharpe ratio.

### Key Features
- **Advanced Feature Engineering**: 100+ sophisticated financial features
- **Multiple ML Algorithms**: Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, Logistic Regression
- **Comprehensive Backtesting**: Portfolio-level performance analysis
- **Statistical Validation**: Bootstrap tests, calibration curves, cross-validation
- **Professional Visualizations**: 15+ charts and performance dashboards

### Business Value
- **Risk Management**: Avoid poorly performing funds
- **Portfolio Optimization**: Focus on high-quality fund selection  
- **Regulatory Compliance**: Monitor fund performance systematically
- **Client Protection**: Prevent losses from weak fund selections

## 📊 Performance Results

### Model Performance
- **Best Model**: Random Forest
- **ROC-AUC**: 0.972 (Excellent discrimination)
- **Precision**: 93% (Low false positives)
- **Recall**: 68% (Catches most poor performers)
- **F1-Score**: 78% (Balanced performance)

### Key Findings
1. **3-Year Alpha** is the most predictive feature
2. **Recent performance metrics** (1M, 3M returns) are highly informative
3. **Fund characteristics** (age, size, expenses) provide additional signal
4. **Risk-adjusted measures** outperform raw returns
